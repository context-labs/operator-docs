## What is Epoch One?
Epoch One was the first Epoch of the Inference.net network. It ran from March 2024 to November 2024. Workers were able to earn \$INT tokens by providing compute resources to the network.

## What is Epoch Two?
Epoch Two is the second Epoch of the Inference.net network. It is started running in December 2024 and ended in April 2025.

## Where are my Epoch One rewards?
If you participated in Epoch One as a worker, you can view your Epoch One balance in the settings page of the Inference.net dashboard [here](https://inference.supply/dashboard/settings).

## Should I rent GPUs?
Inference.net is neutral on this topic. The majority of our users own the GPUs they use to run Inference.net.

## I'm getting an error about Duplicate GPUs
We only allow one node per logical GPU device. If you are getting this error while trying to start an instance, it is likely that an instance is already running on that GPU. If you are sure that no instance is running on that GPU, please open a ticket on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kuzco).

## How do I get support?
